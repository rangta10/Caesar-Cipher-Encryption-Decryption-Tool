# 🧩 Caesar Cipher Encryption-Decryption Tool

A simple Python-based tool to **encrypt** and **decrypt** text using the classic **Caesar Cipher** algorithm.  
This project demonstrates fundamental cryptography concepts such as substitution ciphers, ASCII manipulation, and brute-force decryption.

---

## 🔍 Overview

The **Caesar Cipher** is one of the earliest and simplest encryption techniques, involving shifting each letter of the plaintext by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.  
This tool allows users to:
- Encrypt plaintext messages with a given shift key.
- Decrypt ciphertext messages using the same or brute-forced key.
- Explore how character shifting affects message readability.

## ⚙️ Features

✅ Encrypts and decrypts messages using a user-defined shift value  
✅ Supports **both uppercase and lowercase** letters  
✅ Handles non-alphabetic characters gracefully  
✅ Includes a **brute-force mode** to try all possible shifts  
✅ Built using **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** for easy visualization and learning

## 🧠 Example

```python
Plaintext  : HELLO WORLD
Shift Key  : 3
Ciphertext : KHOOR ZRUOG
To decrypt:

python
Copy code
Ciphertext : KHOOR ZRUOG
Shift Key  : 3
Plaintext  : HELLO WORLD
🧰 Technologies Used
Language: Python

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

Concepts: Cryptography, ASCII manipulation, String processing

🚀 How to Run
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/rangta10/Caesar-Cipher-Encryption-Decryption-Tool.git
